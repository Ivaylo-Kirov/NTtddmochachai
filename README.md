mocha is the testing framework and runs your test cases > it can run on its own if you just use NODE's assertion library > but chai is added for better usability so you have access to expect(sum(so, and so)).to.equal(5) > I think Jasmine was alternative which combined the two, but really it's all the same at the end.. hook up to your functionality, write test cases, and see what the results are

### Chai
Can be referred to as the assertion library

### Mocha
Can be referred to as the test framework which runs all the test cases
